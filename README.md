# Getting Started with Create React App
### Tech stack
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Some of the components were built with the ### Tailwind Css 
The test was done with React Testing library (Unit Testing)

### Logic
all components are controlled by the parent (uplifting State)
for this task I used the React useState and useEffect hooks 

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
